    Optimizing Lithium-Ion Battery Anodes: Investigating CMC Binder Interfaces and Next-Generation Li-CMC for Superior Interfacial Stability
  </h2>

  <p>
    At NYU’s Transformative Materials & Devices Lab, I conducted a comparative study on 
    <strong>PVDF vs. CMC binders in graphite anodes</strong> for lithium-ion batteries—focusing on 
    sustainability, interfacial stability, and capacity retention.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>

  <p>
    Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), the commercially used lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode binder, relies
    on the toxic, non-renewable solvent NMP. By contrast, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a water-soluble
    alternative that improves safety and sustainability. In this study, electrodes were fabricated with 95%
    graphite and 5% binder, assembled into CR2032 coin cells, and tested using galvanostatic cycling and EIS.
  </p>

  <p>
    CMC-based anodes exhibited higher reversible capacities (peak 314 mAh/g) compared to PVDF (peak 280 mAh/g),
    with both achieving high Coulombic efficiencies above 99.7%. At higher C-rates, both cells displayed
    capacity fade correlated with increased charge-transfer resistance. Preliminary synthesis of 
    <strong>lithium-substituted CMC (Li-CMC)</strong> suggests potential for improved SEI stability, though full validation is future work.
  </p>

  <p>
    These findings indicate that while CMC already surpasses PVDF in performance and environmental impact,
    binder chemistry can be further optimized to improve cycling stability in next-generation batteries.
