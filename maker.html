  <h2>Smart Desk Assistant – Engineering Prototype</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a compact, Arduino-powered smart assistant designed to automate desktop tasks, 
    integrate sensors, and provide an accessible interface for day-to-day productivity. Below are 
    images of the early-stage prototype, wiring, and assembly.

  <h2>Development Notes & Features</h2>

<p class="section-description">
  Below is a summary of the major engineering updates I implemented while iterating on the Smart Desk 
  Assistant. Each subsystem has been refined to improve robustness, responsiveness, and real-world usability.
</p>

<h3>Enhanced Lighting Detection</h3>
<p class="section-description">
  The LED indicator system now uses external digital LEDs on the breadboard instead of the Arduino’s 
  built-in LED. This provides stronger brightness and a more consistent signal. A hysteresis-based 
  threshold was added to prevent flickering and ensure stable low-light detection.
</p>

<h3>Ultrasonic Presence Tracking</h3>
<p class="section-description">
  The ultrasonic module now includes a dual-threshold hysteresis buffer, allowing the assistant to reliably 
  distinguish between a user and background objects such as a chair. This prevents false triggers when I 
  lean back, shift position, or temporarily move out-of-range.
</p>

<h3>Closed-Loop Cooling System</h3>
<p class="section-description">
  A PN2222 transistor controls a small DC cooling fan, creating a closed-loop temperature regulation system. 
  When the workspace temperature rises above 27°C and I am present at the desk, the fan automatically 
  activates to maintain a comfortable environment.
</p>

<h3>Productivity Timer Integration</h3>
<p class="section-description">
  Three physical buttons—pause, reset, and skip—were wired into the system to support full control over 
  a productivity session timer. The LCD display dynamically updates the timer status and no longer shows 
  drifting or unstable behavior after pauses or resets.
